/// Components
///
/// Each stylesheet in this directory should describe a single modular element.
/// Components may have states but not parent/child relationships (those
/// elements belong in the `/patterns` directory instead.
///
/// @example scss
///   .button {}
///   .button--disabled {}
///   .alert {}
///   .badge {}
///
/// Import all components into this file to include them in the app.
